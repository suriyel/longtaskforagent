# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **Claude Code skill plugin** called `long-task-agent` that enables multi-session execution of complex software projects exceeding a single context window. It implements a multi-phase architecture (Requirements → UCD → Design → ATS → Initializer → Worker → System Testing → Finalize, with an Increment re-entry point) with persistent state bridging via on-disk artifacts.

The skill system follows the **superpowers architectural pattern**: 13 independent skills loaded on-demand via the `Skill` tool, with a bootstrap router (`using-long-task`) injected at session start via hook.

## Architecture

### 13-Skill System

The skill system uses on-demand loading via the `Skill` tool. Only the bootstrap router is loaded at session start; other skills are loaded as needed.

#### Phase Skills (loaded one at a time based on project state)

| Skill | Phase | Trigger |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `using-long-task` | Bootstrap | Injected via SessionStart hook into every session |
| `long-task-hotfix` | Hotfix | bugfix-request.json exists (HIGHEST priority — above increment) |
| `long-task-increment` | Phase 1.5 | increment-request.json exists |
| `long-task-requirements` | Phase 0a | No SRS, no design doc, no feature-list.json |
| `long-task-ucd` | Phase 0b | SRS exists, no UCD doc, no design doc, no feature-list.json |
| `long-task-design` | Phase 0c | SRS + UCD exist (or no UI features), no design doc, no feature-list.json |
| `long-task-ats` | Phase 0d | Design doc exists, no ATS doc, no feature-list.json |
| `long-task-init` | Phase 1 | ATS doc exists (or auto-skipped for tiny projects), no feature-list.json |
| `long-task-work` | Phase 2 | feature-list.json exists, some active features failing |
| `long-task-st` | Phase 3 | feature-list.json exists, ALL active features passing |

#### Discipline Skills (loaded by long-task-work as sub-skills)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `long-task-feature-design` | Feature Detailed Design — interface contracts, algorithm pseudocode, state diagrams, boundary matrices, test inventory (bridges system design → TDD) |
| `long-task-tdd` | TDD Red-Green-Refactor |
| `long-task-quality` | Coverage Gate + Feature-Scoped Mutation Gate |
| `long-task-feature-st` | Black-Box Feature Acceptance Testing — self-managed environment lifecycle, Chrome DevTools MCP + ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 (per-feature, after Quality Gates) |


#### Meta Skills (invoked conditionally by phase skills)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `long-task-finalize` | Post-ST Documentation — scenario-based usage examples generation + RELEASE_NOTES/task-progress finalization (after ST Go verdict) |
| `long-task-retrospective` | Skill Self-Evolution — consolidate retrospective records and upload to REST API (after ST Go verdict, if authorized) |

```

### Eight-Phase Workflow

0a. **Requirements** (`long-task-requirements`):
   - Two-tier adaptive elicitation: **Lite track** (3–5 rounds, clear-scope projects) and **Expert track** (10–20 rounds, complex domains)
   - Tier auto-selected via 5 complexity signals (scope, actors, integrations, domain, description style); escalation from Lite → Expert if complexity surfaces
   - Expert track adds: 5-Whys root cause / JTBD / Pain Map (problem framing), scenario walkthroughs, hypothesis-correction tables, hidden requirements discovery, alignment validation with JTBD gate
   - Structured elicitation aligned with ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148
   - Challenge each requirement against 8 quality attributes
   - Apply EARS templates, assign unique IDs, write Given/When/Then acceptance criteria
   - Anti-pattern detection (weasel words, compound requirements, design leakage)
   - Save SRS to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-srs.md`
   - **Hard gate**: no UCD/design until SRS approved

0b. **UCD Style Guide** (`long-task-ucd`):
   - Takes approved SRS as input; auto-skips to design if no UI features
   - Define visual style direction (2-3 options), style tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
   - Generate text-to-image prompts per component type and per page
   - Save UCD to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-ucd.md`
   - **Hard gate**: no design until UCD approved (for UI projects)
   - Referenced by design (UI/UX section), worker (frontend features), and review (UCD compliance)

0c. **Design** (`long-task-design`):
   - Takes approved SRS + UCD as input (WHAT + LOOK → HOW)
   - Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs, evaluate against SRS constraints/NFRs
   - Per-feature detailed design with Mermaid diagrams (class, sequence, flow)
   - Third-party dependency versions with compatibility verification
   - Development plan with milestones, task decomposition, priority ordering
   - Get section-by-section design approval
   - Save design doc to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
   - **Hard gate**: no coding until design approved

0d. **Acceptance Test Strategy** (`long-task-ats`):
   - Takes approved SRS + Design + UCD as input (WHAT + HOW + LOOK → TEST STRATEGY)
   - Maps every FR/NFR/IFR to acceptance scenarios with required test categories
   - Category assignment: FUNC+BNDRY (all FRs), +SEC (input/auth), +UI (ui:true), +PERF (NFR with metrics)
   - NFR test method matrix with tools, thresholds, and load parameters
   - Cross-feature integration scenarios pre-planned for ST phase
   - Risk-driven test priority ordering
   - Independent ATS reviewer subagent (7 dimensions: R1-R7) with custom review template support
   - Auto-skip for tiny projects (≤5 FR): embeds simplified mapping in design doc
   - Save ATS to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-ats.md`
   - **Hard gate**: no Init until ATS approved (or auto-skipped)
   - Downstream: constrains Init `srs_trace` → ATS category lookup and feature-st test case derivation

**Hotfix** (`long-task-hotfix`):
   - Triggered by `bugfix-request.json` signal file (HIGHEST routing priority — above increment)
   - Validates signal file via `validate_bugfix_request.py`
   - Reproduces the bug; confirms root cause via 4-phase systematic debugging
   - Enqueues bug as `category: "bugfix"` feature in `feature-list.json` (status: "failing")
   - Deletes signal file; router auto-detects failing bugfix feature → Worker
   - Worker runs full TDD → Quality → ST → Inline Compliance pipeline for the fix
   - Worker uses `"fix:"` commit prefix and `### Fixed` RELEASE_NOTES entry for bugfix features

1.5. **Increment** (`long-task-increment`):
   - Triggered by `increment-request.json` signal file (high routing priority — below hotfix)
   - Collects new/modified/deprecated requirements with EARS templates
   - Impact analysis against existing features (user-approved)
   - Updates SRS, Design, UCD documents **in place** (git tracks history)
   - Appends new features to `feature-list.json` with `wave` metadata
   - Resets modified features to `"failing"`, marks deprecated features with `"deprecated": true`
   - Deletes signal file on completion; router auto-detects failing features → Worker

1. **Initializer Session** (`long-task-init`):
   - Reads both SRS and design documents
   - Runs `init_project.py` to scaffold deterministic artifacts
   - LLM generates project-tailored `long-task-guide.md`
   - Decomposes SRS requirements into 10-200+ verifiable features in `feature-list.json`
   - Creates project skeleton + initial git commit

2. **Worker Session** (`long-task-work` orchestrator):
   - Orient → Bootstrap → Config Gate → DevTools Gate → Plan
   - **TDD** (`long-task-tdd`): Red → Green → Refactor (driven by Feature Design Test Inventory + SRS)
   - **Quality** (`long-task-quality`): Coverage Gate → Feature-Scoped Mutation Gate
   - **ST Acceptance** (`long-task-feature-st`): Black-box acceptance testing — self-managed start/cleanup, Chrome DevTools MCP UI execution + ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 per feature
   - **Inline Check**: Mechanical compliance verification (interface contracts, test inventory, dependency versions, UCD tokens)
   - Persist → Continue (chains to ST when all features pass)

3. **System Testing** (`long-task-st`):
   - Cross-feature & system-wide verification (per-feature ST already done in Worker cycles)
   - ST Readiness Gate → ST Plan (RTM) → Regression → Integration → Cross-Feature E2E → System-Wide NFR
   - Compatibility → Exploratory → Defect Triage → ST Report → Verdict (Go/No-Go) → Finalize
   - If Critical/Major defects found → loops back to Worker for fixes
   - Aligned with IEEE 829 and ISTQB best practices

   **Finalize** (`long-task-finalize`):
   - Invoked by ST after Go/Conditional-Go verdict
   - Generates scenario-based usage examples for external developers and AI Code Agents
   - Updates RELEASE_NOTES.md and task-progress.md with ST completion
   - Git commits all documentation artifacts

### Critical Rules

- **Config gate before planning**: Never plan or code when required configs are missing; load the project config first (per `long-task-guide.md` Config Management section), prompt user for missing values via text input, save to the appropriate config file
- **Requirements before UCD/design**: Run requirements elicitation; no UCD/design until SRS approved
- **UCD before design (UI projects)**: Run UCD style guide generation; no design until UCD approved (auto-skips for non-UI projects)
- **Design before ATS**: Run design phase; no ATS until design approved
- **ATS before implementation**: Run ATS phase; no coding until ATS approved (auto-skips for tiny projects ≤5 FR)
- **ATS constrains downstream**: Init `srs_trace` → ATS category lookup drives `ui` flag assignment; feature-st test case derivation must satisfy ATS category requirements
- **ATS reviewer is mandatory**: Independent subagent reviews ATS before approval; max 2 fix rounds then user escalation
- **Strict TDD**: Always Red→Green→Refactor→Coverage→Mutation
- **Coverage gate after TDD Green**: Run coverage tool, verify line >= 90%, branch >= 80%
- **Mutation gate after TDD Refactor**: For projects with > `mutation_full_threshold` active features, run feature-scoped mutation (changed files + feature's tests only); for smaller projects run full mutation. Verify score >= 80%. Full mutation runs during ST phase (Step 3b) for all projects.
- **Verification enforcement**: Never mark "passing" without fresh evidence
- **Inline compliance check after every feature**: mechanical interface contract, test inventory, dependency version, and UCD token verification (no SubAgent)
- **Systematic debugging**: Never guess-and-fix; always trace root cause first
- **One feature per session**: End session after completing one feature; multi-feature automation is handled by the external auto-loop script (`scripts/auto_loop.py`)
- **UI features require Chrome DevTools MCP testing**: Mark with `"ui": true`
- **UI features require positive rendering verification**: Feature Design must include a Visual Rendering Contract (selectors, render triggers, positive assertions + interactive depth assertions); TDD Rule 7 writes tests asserting visual elements are present AND interactive (not just error-free); Feature-ST uses Layer 1b script to verify rendering, then performs Exploratory Visual Assessment (Step 8) with 4 grading criteria (Rendering Completeness, Interactive Depth, Visual Coherence, Functional Accuracy). A blank canvas with zero errors is NOT a passing UI. "Display-only" elements that render but don't respond to interaction are Major defects.
- **System testing before release**: When all features pass, run ST phase (regression, integration, E2E, NFR, exploratory); no release without Go verdict
- **Hotfix before increment**: When both `bugfix-request.json` and `increment-request.json` exist, hotfix runs first; `increment-request.json` is preserved for next session
- **Bug fixes via hotfix skill only**: Never manually add bugfix features to feature-list.json; use the `long-task-hotfix` skill so root cause is confirmed and the fix is fully traceable
- **Incremental changes via increment skill only**: Never manually edit feature-list.json to add/modify/deprecate features; use the `long-task-increment` skill for audited, tracked changes
- **srs_trace required per feature**: Every feature must include `srs_trace` (array of SRS requirement IDs); `verification_steps` is optional
- **ST acceptance test cases after Quality Gates**: Generate and execute ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 acceptance test cases per feature after TDD and Quality Gates; test cases validate implementation against requirements
- **Deprecated features excluded**: Worker skips deprecated features; ST readiness ignores them; routing counts only active features
- **Service lifecycle via env-guide.md**: All service start/stop/restart operations use the commands in `env-guide.md`. No implicit hook-based cleanup exists. Always follow the 4-step Restart Protocol between test cycles. Always capture the first 30 lines of startup output to extract PID/port.
- **Startup output in code**: Any code that starts a server or background service must print bound port, PID, and ready signal at startup — enables reliable extraction via `head -30` of the startup log.
- **Real tests mandatory for features with external dependencies**: Features with `required_configs[]` containing connection-string keys (URL, HOST, PORT, DSN, URI, CONNECTION, ENDPOINT) cannot claim pure-function exemption. `check_real_tests.py --require-for-deps` enforces this mechanically. If configs are missing, use AskUserQuestion — never skip real tests.

- `verification_steps` (feature): Array of behavioral scenario strings — optional; if present, provides supplementary test context

ST test case fields (all optional, backward-compatible):
- `st_case_template_path` (root): Custom ST test case template path (defines structure)
- `st_case_example_path` (root): Example file path (defines style, language, detail level)
- `st_case_path` (feature): Path to generated ST test case document
- `st_case_count` (feature): Number of ST test cases generated for this feature

Bugfix-specific fields (all optional, only on `category: "bugfix"` features):
- `bug_severity` (feature): Severity of the bug — `"Critical"`, `"Major"`, `"Minor"`, or `"Cosmetic"`
- `bug_source` (feature): Where the bug was found — `"manual-testing"` (set by hotfix skill)
- `fixed_feature_id` (feature): ID of the feature this bug fix relates to (or `null` if unlinked)
- `root_cause` (feature): Confirmed one-sentence root cause (set by hotfix skill after systematic debugging)

Increment-specific fields:
- `waves[]` (root): Tracks each increment batch — `id` (0=initial), `date`, `description`
- `wave` (feature): Which wave introduced/last modified this feature (default 0)
- `deprecated` (feature): If `true`, excluded from Worker/ST/routing counts
- `deprecated_reason` (feature): Required when `deprecated=true`
- `supersedes` (feature): ID of the deprecated feature this one replaces (optional)

## Long-Task Agent

This project uses a multi-session agent workflow with 13 skills loaded on-demand.
The `using-long-task` skill is injected at session start and routes to the correct phase.
Flow: Requirements (SRS) → UCD (UI projects) → Design → ATS (Acceptance Test Strategy) → Init → Worker cycles → System Testing → Finalize.
Incremental development: place `increment-request.json` → Increment skill updates SRS/Design/ATS/UCD in place → new features appended → Worker cycles → ST.

Key files: `docs/plans/*-srs.md` (SRS), `docs/plans/*-deferred.md` (deferred backlog), `docs/plans/*-ucd.md` (UCD style guide), `docs/plans/*-design.md` (design), `docs/plans/*-ats.md` (ATS — acceptance test strategy with requirement→scenario mapping, reviewed by ats-reviewer subagent), `feature-list.json` (task inventory), `task-progress.md` (session log), `RELEASE_NOTES.md` (changelog), `docs/features/*.md` (per-feature detailed design), `docs/test-cases/feature-*.md` (per-feature ST test cases), `docs/plans/*-st-report.md` (ST report), `increment-request.json` (increment signal).
